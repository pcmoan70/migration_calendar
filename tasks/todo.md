# Map Points Feature (v1)

## Decisions
1. **Manual add**: long-press on touch / right-click on desktop → opens a dialog with name, tags, notes.
2. **Tags**: free-form, comma-separated. Tags from imported files merge into the same pool.
3. **Filter**: multi-select OR — chips for each unique tag + "(no tag)"; active chips show only matching points.
4. **Import**: KML + GPX (DOMParser) + **KMZ** via native `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` + a minimal local ZIP central-directory parser — no JSZip vendored.

## Data model
- `GeoState.mapPoints` = array of `{ id, lat, lon, name, tags[], note, source, createdAt }`.
- `GeoState.mapPointsFilter` = array of active tag strings (`""` for "(no tag)").

## Tasks
- [ ] Storage helpers: `loadMapPoints`, `saveMapPoints`, `addMapPoint`, `updateMapPoint`, `deleteMapPoint`, `clearMapPoints`.
- [ ] Tag-colour palette + hash function.
- [ ] Leaflet layer group + per-tag marker rendering; filter respect.
- [ ] `map.on("contextmenu", addPointHere)` → opens the point dialog at lat/lon.
- [ ] Marker `.on("click", openPointEdit)` → same dialog, prefilled, with delete button.
- [ ] Header dropdown "Points (N)" mirroring the Checklists one: list of points with chips + distance + delete, "Import file" button, "Clear all", and the filter chip bar with all distinct tags.
- [ ] File-picker accepts `.kml,.kmz,.gpx` and dispatches by extension.
- [ ] Parsers:
  - `parseKml(text)` → DOMParser, walk `Placemark` nodes with `Point/coordinates`. Name from `<name>`, tags merge from folder names + `<ExtendedData>` `<Data name="tags">` + comma-separated `<description>`. Drop placemarks without `<Point>`.
  - `parseGpx(text)` → DOMParser, walk `<wpt lat="" lon="">` nodes. Name from `<name>`, tags from `<type>` and (`<sym>`).
  - `parseKmz(arrayBuffer)` → minimal ZIP central-directory parser → find `*.kml` entry → `DecompressionStream('deflate-raw')` → `parseKml`.
- [ ] i18n: ~12 keys in 15 languages.

## Verification (headless)
- [ ] Right-click on map → dialog opens → save → point appears, persisted to localStorage.
- [ ] Import a synthetic KML (3 placemarks, 2 tags) → 3 points added with merged tag pool.
- [ ] Import a synthetic GPX (2 waypoints) → 2 points added.
- [ ] Import a synthetic KMZ (1 KML inside, deflate-compressed) → 1 point added.
- [ ] Click a tag chip → marker count drops to those matching.
- [ ] Click a point marker → edit dialog opens with prefilled fields, delete works.

## Out of scope (v1)
- Per-tag icon/color customization UI (color is hashed by first tag automatically).
- Export back to KML/GPX (could add later).
- Clustering at high counts (uncluster at hundreds).
- Sync across devices (localStorage only).

# Upload Checklist Feature — eBird (v1)

## Decisions (user-confirmed)
1. **Mechanism**: CSV download in eBird Record Format; structure the code so a future API-submit hook can plug in.
2. **Scope**: One checklist = one upload group. User can split/merge log entries into ad-hoc groups in the review screen.
3. **Entry point**: New "Review & upload" button on the field-checklist page → dedicated review page.

## Existing model (no change needed, append-only field on entries)
- `fieldChecklists[id]` = `{ id, title, lat, lon, day, createdAt, log[], seen{} }` (one record per place+day).
- Each `log` entry: `{ id, ts, lat, lon, key, count, act, note }`.
- **Add**: optional `entry.grp` (group key, string). Absent → default group `"a"`. Backward compatible.

## Tasks

### 1. Data
- [ ] `entry.grp` (string) added to log entries. Default group when missing = `"a"`.
- [ ] Add `record.upload[grpKey]` to persist per-group submission metadata (start time, duration, protocol, distance/area, observers, effort comments, submission comments, state, country, location-name override).
- [ ] Helpers: `recordGroups(rec)` → array of group keys present in `rec.log` (+ any orphans from `rec.upload`). `entriesByGroup(rec, grp)` → log entries in that group, sorted by ts. `aggregateSpecies(entries)` → array `{ key, count, breeding, notes, firstTs, lastTs }`.

### 2. eBird mapping
- [ ] `EBIRD_BREEDING` map: subset of `FIELD_ACTS` → eBird breeding codes (NB, FL, ON, FY, NY, CF, FS, UN, DD, A, C, N, T, P, S, S7, H, F, …). Non-breeding activities pass through as plain text in "Identification details".
- [ ] `ebirdCsv(rec, grpKey)`: produces a string in Record Format (header row + one row per species). Columns:
  `Common Name, Genus, Species, Number, Identification details, Observation Date, Observation Time, State, Country, Location Name, Latitude, Longitude, Protocol, Duration (min), All observations reported, Distance Covered (km), Area Covered (ha), Number of Observers, Effort Comments, Submission Comments`.

### 3. UI — `#review-page`
- [ ] New full-screen page, opened by a new toolbar button on the field-checklist page.
- [ ] Group cards: editable meta + aggregated species list (count/breeding/note editable; expand to show source entries with "Move to group ▾").
- [ ] "+ Checklist" button creates a new group.
- [ ] Per-group "Download eBird CSV" button.
- [ ] Per-group "Submit to eBird API" placeholder (disabled tooltip "partner-only").

### 4. i18n
- [ ] Add ~25 keys to all 15 language blocks in `docs/i18n/strings.js` (English source; translations for sv/de/es/fr/nl/no/it/pl/cs/et/lt/fi/da/pt). Keep CRLF.

### 5. Housekeeping
- [ ] Bump SW to v73, update `last-change.txt`.

### 6. Verification (headless)
- [ ] Aggregation: two `barswa` entries with counts 3 + 2 → one row `count=5`.
- [ ] CSV roundtrip: header row + correct column count per data row.
- [ ] Breeding code mapping: `song` → `S`, `nestbuild` → `NB`.
- [ ] Move entry to new group → species moves between groups.
- [ ] Protocol Traveling shows Distance row.

## Out of scope (v1)
- Tracking which checklists were already uploaded.
- iNaturalist (the review page leaves a `destinations[]` seam).
- State/country auto-detection.
- Per-entry coords in the CSV (eBird Record Format takes one location per checklist).

## Review

Shipped across **v73** (upload) and **v74** (sex toggle).

**v73 — upload feature (`f3cd0b1`)**
- `entry.grp` and `record.upload[grp]` added; recordGroups / entriesInGroup / aggregateForUpload helpers; EBIRD_BREEDING map (19 codes) and ebirdRecordCsv producing valid Record-Format CSVs.
- New `#review-page` (full-screen, modeled on `#entry-page`) with one group card per checklist, editable meta block (protocol/time/duration/distance/observers/all-obs/loc/state/country/notes), aggregated species list with editable count/breeding code/note, expandable per-entry "Move to…" menus.
- "+ Checklist" allocates next free group letter via `nextGroupKey`; the empty group is persisted via `rec.upload[k] = {}`.
- "Submit to eBird" hook in place but only surfaces a stub message — eBird's submit API is partner-only.
- 28 new i18n keys, 15 languages.
- Headless CDP test verified: counts sum (3+2→5), breeding codes (song→S, nestbuild→NB, flyover→F), CSV structure (header + 3 rows), move-to-new-group splits a species across A/B.

**v74 — sex toggle (`70b61b9`)**
- `cd().sex` and `entry.sex` added (cycle order `"" → m → f → p → fl`).
- `setFcSex` and `nextSex` helpers; `.fc-sex-btn` cycle button on each card.
- Sex shown on entry summary lines and editable as a select on the entry-edit page.
- `aggregateForUpload` tracks `sexCounts`; CSV's Identification details now includes `"3 ♂, 2 ♀, 1 ♀?"`-style breakdown when sex info is present.
- `chk.sex` key added in 15 languages.
- Headless verified the 5-state cycle, the CSV aggregation, and the entry-edit round-trip.

## Out of scope (still)
- Tracking which checklists were already uploaded.
- iNaturalist upload (the `destinations[]` seam is in place).
- State/country auto-detection from coords.
- Per-entry coords in the CSV (eBird Record Format takes one location per checklist).
